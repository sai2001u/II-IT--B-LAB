# AIM  OF THE EXPERIMENT
write a program using  iterative function  for linear search
# BRIEF DESCRPITION OF LINEAR SEARCH
   • Sequential search is used whenever the list is not ordered.
   • Generally we use the technique only for small lists or lists that are not searched often.
   • In the sequential search , we start searching for the target from the beginning of the list, and we continue until the we find the target or 
        until we are sure that it is not in the list.
   • This gives us two possibilities:
          either we find it or
          we reach the end of the list
