# AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT
   write a program using recursive function for linear search
# step by step procedure 
• Sequential search is used whenever the list is not ordered.
• Generally we use the technique only for small lists or lists that are not searched often
• In the sequential search , we start searching for the target from the beginning of the list, and we continue until the we find the target or 
    until we are sure that it is not in the list.
• This gives us two possibilities:
   either we found it or we reach the end of the list
   # explaning step by step each output:
We have the array elements [10,6,8,15,20,3,14,99,66,30]
For the output 1 the key element we need to search is 66
In the iterative process we check if the element and the key value are same
In the iteration  1 a[0] = 10 key is not equal to 66,so the case fails
In the iteration 2 a[1] = 6 key is not equal to 66,so the case  fails
Similary iteration continues until the element and the key value are same
In the iteration 9 a[8] = 66 is equal to 66 ,so the case passed
In the function the iteration takes place and the element with index printed to the output
If all the iteration cases fails then it returns that the element is not found
For the output 2 the key element we need to search is 0
In the iterative process we check if the element and the key value are same
In the iteration  1 a[0] = 10 key is not equal to 0,so the case fails
In the iteration 2 a[1] = 6 key is not equal to 0,so the case  fails
Similary iteration continues until the element and the key value are same
after checking all the iteration the key value is not found
So the output is the element is not found
